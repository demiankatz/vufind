; This section shows which search types will display in the basic search box at
; the top of WorldCat v2 pages.  The name of each setting below corresponds with one
; or more indices defined in the WorldCat API (multiple values are separated by
; colons).  The value of each setting is the text to display on screen.  All
; on-screen text will be run through the translator, so be sure to update language
; files if necessary.  The order of these settings will be maintained in the
; drop-down list in the UI.
